I'll get a more comprehensive article up shortly, but I've been benchmarking the NH57AF1 in Windows and it's turning out pretty good!

I recorded the benchmarks using an {{< open_links_in_target_blank href="https://psqd.pw/ezcap284" value="ezcap 284" >}} which is a standalone hardware capture device (so I don't have to do a screen capture on the laptop itself which might skew the benchmark results), so the recording quality doesn't really match the actual display output. I'll be uploading those soon as well.
